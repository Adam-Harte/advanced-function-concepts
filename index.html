		<h1>Advanced Function Concepts</h1>
		<h3>Pure Functions and Side Effects</h3>
		<p>
			Pure functions is a concept of writing functions that always return the
			same output given the same parameters and that do not cause 'side
			effects'. Side effects are anything in your function that changes data
			outside the functons scope e.g. changing variables declared outside the
			function, making HTTP requests that change app data.
		</p>
		<h3>Impure Functions</h3>
		<p>
			Impure functions are the opposite of pure functions in that they can be
			unpredictable and not always return the same output given the same
			parameters and can also trigger side effects. It is generally a good idea
			to make as many of your functions pure as possible.
		</p>
		<h3>Factory Functions</h3>
		<p>
			Factory functions are functions which create and return other functions
			with pre-configured arguments typically from parameters of the factory
			function itself to then pass to the functions it returns. This is useful
			for defining function with arguments that never change so that you dont
			have to keep defining that argument every time you need to call that
			function.
		</p>
		<h3>Closures</h3>
		<p>
			Closures is the concept of functions having their own lexical enviroment
			scope and therefore every function is a closure. Every function you create
			then creates a lexical enviroment for that function which gives it
			variable scope for variables defined inside that function as well as
			variables in other lexical enviroments surrounding it. Therefore for non
			nested fucntion declarations they have access to their own variables and
			then the lexical enviroment surrounding that function as well in this case
			the 'global scope'. For nested functions they have access to their own
			declared variables and also the lexical enviroments of the functions
			declared surrounding them.

		<h1>Advanced Function Concepts</h1>
		<h3>Pure Functions and Side Effects</h3>
		<p>
			Pure functions is a concept of writing functions that always return the
			same output given the same parameters and that do not cause 'side
			effects'. Side effects are anything in your function that changes data
			outside the functons scope e.g. changing variables declared outside the
			function, making HTTP requests that change app data.
		</p>
		<h3>Impure Functions</h3>
		<p>
			Impure functions are the opposite of pure functions in that they can be
			unpredictable and not always return the same output given the same
			parameters and can also trigger side effects. It is generally a good idea
			to make as many of your functions pure as possible.
